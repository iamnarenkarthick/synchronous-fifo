# 📦 FIFO Buffer - Verilog Implementation

This project implements a **First-In First-Out (FIFO) Buffer** in Verilog HDL with a depth of 8 and a data width of 32 bits. FIFO buffers are essential components in digital systems to manage the orderly flow of data. A testbench is also included to validate the buffer functionality through simulation and waveform visualization.

## 🧠 Overview

A FIFO buffer is a queue structure that ensures the first data written into the buffer is the first data read out. This kind of buffer is particularly useful when data needs to be transferred between two hardware modules operating at different clock domains or speeds.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

FIFO buffers are commonly used in various real-world systems:

- **Networking Devices:** Routers and switches use FIFO buffers to store and forward packets.
- **Audio/Video Streaming:** To buffer incoming media data and avoid glitches caused by varying data rates.
- **UART Communication:** FIFO is used to store incoming/outgoing data bytes to handle rate mismatch between CPU and peripheral.
- **DMA Transfers:** FIFO buffers help manage data between memory and I/O peripherals efficiently.
- **Embedded Systems:** Useful in sensor data acquisition and processing pipelines.

## ▶️ How to Simulate

### 📌 Add to Testbench

Make sure your testbench includes:

```verilog
$dumpfile("fifo_sync_tb.vcd");
$dumpvars(0, fifo_sync_tb);
